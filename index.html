            <p class="lead">In comparison to any other VCS, git has its own way of storing information which I found very interesting and extremely useful. Usually, when we think of the way we save files and documents, we create the file and we make changes. We proceed to then saving those changes, eliminating the first draft of that file or document. As we continue to edit this file and saving the newer versions, the old versions are lost. That is what differentiates git from other services. Git saves every version of your file or document, providing a continuous stream of snapshots of your work. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another aspect of git that I found very useful was how you have the option to clone an existing git repository. You have to use the command “clone” and git will receive a full copy of all data that the server has. This can be imperative when software is being developed, or when multiple people are contributing to one program because the user has access to all versions of the file. They can look into past files and see how the final product came to be, or check for where errors were committed and where things went wrong. These versions can be obtained by running the command “git clone”. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When you clone files to your git repository on your local machine, you are able to check the status of your files. What does this mean? It is yet another useful tool I found about git because by using the command “git status” you are able to see in what state your files are in. Let’s say you cloned a file but you have not yet made any changes to the file or document. With this command, it shows you that this is an “untracked file”. This means that you have not made any changes to this file, therefore it is not being tracked. This can be useful when tracking progress and making sure your files get saved and are being tracked by using a simple command for an update. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Short history of git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It is always important to know background information of the programs you are using, just to know where everything started and how things developed and came to be. Git started from the failure of relationships between Linux Kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper. Linux kernel is an open source software project that used a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. When this relationships broke down, it prompted the Lunux community to develop their own tool with goals of speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, full distribution, and able to handle large project. In 2005, Git was born and became an easy to use program with these qualities. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An interesting section of this part was the distributed version control systems. It explains how not only can users see the latest snapshot of their files or documents, but they are also able to mirror the repository. This means that if any of the servers die while being shared with other servers, any of the repositories  can be copied back to the server in order to restore it. In essence, it would be hard to lose a project because every time the file is cloned, it is basically a full backup of all the data. This system works strongly even if multiple users are working on it, which it optimal for simultaneously working on a single project. </p>
